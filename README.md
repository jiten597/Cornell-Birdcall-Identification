# Cornell-Birdcall-Identification
In this competition, I identify a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. A specific named bird species may be in the forefront, with anthropogenic sounds (such as airline overflights) or other bird and non-bird calls (such as chipmunk calls) in the background. Researchers will have a greater understanding of how pollution levels, changes in habitat quality, and the success of restoration initiatives thanks to this work. Reliable machine listeners would also enable data-driven conservation at a scale not now conceivable and would permit conservationists to deploy more recording units globally. Many living things, including humans and birds, could see a significant improvement in their quality of life as a result of the ultimate conservation efforts.
